1. What do we mean by recent? I'm currently just grabbing the first pages worth of events. Do we want to add a custom filter that can be passed to the endpont?

2. Do we want to include all events (e.g. WatchEvent, ForkEvent)? Currently we check every GitHubEvent, though we can easily create a list of accepted events.

3. How should we handle authentication? Who will be using this API?

4. How should we handle users with no activity? Currently returning empty repositories array with total_events: 0.

5. Currently we are using an in-memory cache. For production, should we use Redis or another distributed cache? We may need a way to invalidate too.

6. Should we implement client-side rate limiting to prevent hitting GitHub's API limits?

7. Should we support pagination for users with many repositories? Maybe we can add a paraameter that tells the API how many repositories to return, too.

8. Currently using a 30 second timeout for the GitHub API requests. Should we use a different timeout value?

9. Should we add any filters to the API? 

10. Should we support GitHub API tokens for higher rate limits?

11. Should we add any metrics to the API? (response times, cache hit rates, error rates, etc.)

12. Are we going to be using kubrnetes?
